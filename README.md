# Education Authority Northern Ireland (EANI)

This proof-of-concept (PoC) will work with publicly available data from the [Deparment for Education (Northern Ireland)](https://www.education-ni.gov.uk) and the data and analytics platform [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/get-started/microsoft-fabric-overview).

These labs will walk through downloading data and using various Microsoft Fabric components to load and manipulate the data such as: Data Pipelines, Notebooks, Lakehouses, Data Warehouses, and others such as AI Skill and GraphQL.

Day 1 will focus on **School Attendance**.  Day 2 will be **School Enrolments** which will be a similar process.

## Labs

- [Lab 01 - Download the data](labs/lab01/lab01.md)  
Manually download the data to be used in the labs

2. [Lab 02 - Set up Fabric](labs/lab02/lab02.md)  
Setup a Fabric Capacity, Workspace and Lakehouse in order to import the data

3. [Lab 03 - Import to Lakehouse using Data Pipeline](labs/lab03/lab03.md)  
Import the data to a Lakehouse

4. [Lab 04 - Import to Data Warehouse using Data Pipeline](labs/lab04/lab04.md)  
Import the data to a Data Warehouse

5. [Lab 05 - Sample Notebooks](labs/lab05/lab05.md)
